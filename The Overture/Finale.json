And stronger. And stronger. Yet instead of pouring out of their wound, it seems to pool into their arm. An ugly rotting arm. It shoots forward as if compelled by gravity and burns off its coverings. The mark of Cancer begins to glow on it. No one seems to know what to make of this sight. Until it explodes. Everyone is knocked back by a blinding light and feels intense burning on their skin.\n\nAnd when they can see again, Selle is gone.\n\n((Channel split))","author":{"id":"453258461619159070","name":"dontatmiss","discriminator":"0000","nickname":"Don'tAtmey","color":"#206694","isBot":false,"roles":[{"id":"1303136218174722180","name":"Rean Schwarzer","color":"#206694","position":3}],"avatarUrl":"Assets\\421dadb22ce839fc140f107402df2d7a-0592E.png"},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"stickers":[],"reactions":[],"mentions":[],"inlineEmojis":[]}]},{"guild":{"id":"1303106879529943100","name":"Crossroads of Zodiac: The Overture","iconUrl":"Assets\\1dd89a4270410c67b33d38e6865feea5-0C83D.png"},"channel":{"id":"1307743457963675728","type":"GuildTextChat","categoryId":"1307737351531004135","category":"Golden Castle","name":"selle","topic":null},"dateRange":{"after":null,"before":null},"exportedAt":"2025-09-26T01:36:46.8021513-07:00","messageCount":942,"messages":[{"id":"1419414651774701713","type":"Default","timestamp":"2025-09-21T13:07:04.432-07:00","timestampEdited":null,"callEndedTimestamp":null,"isPinned":false,"content":"You are flying through the air at speeds you cannot quite fathom.

I consider correcting their assessment of Nash’s life status, but don’t bother.\n\n“What… makes an empire fall?” He asks. I ask. I am he. Aeolian Burr.\n\nIt feels odd. Being here. Looking like I currently do. Being with these people.\n\n“One terrible moment? A great tragedy? …No. We have learned as much today. Such is a farce. Often perpetuated by empires themselves.”\n\nI consider Nash Edwardson. Dorrance? Didn’t really get that part. What a miserable child.\n\nMy own mother was a wealthy woman. I never truly felt I knew her, which has always seemed a shame. I enjoy knowing people. …But seeing that boy, I wonder if maybe I was blessed to keep our relationship purely professional, restricted to the obligations it necessitates.\n\n“An empire falls when its people stop believing in it.”\n\nI consider Selle, last name unknown. First name also unknown. Some true colors were definitely unveiled at the end, there. I myself definitely need to learn when to keep my mouth shut — I’ll probably play my cards closer to my chest going forward. But that young… person, exaggerates this fault tenfold. Still. Not a single sentiment expressed was wrong, not entirely. In better circumstances we may have been acquaintances. Though the depths of my platonic affection are, of course, reserved for elsewhere.\n\n“…I’ve known for a while people did not believe in Aragon. But I felt he might be capable of winning them over. Through just  and righteous ruling…”\n\nI consider Aliza Hamill. …To be honest… it’s possible she was always much better than me. I had the resources, so we were able to stand on somewhat equal footing. But was my parentage not a bit more esteemed than hers, I fear she’d have left me in the dust long ago. She’s a stellar artist, and she’d be an even better leader if she didn’t seem to act like such a position were beneath her. …Maybe it is.\n\n“Through fear, silencing dissenters and discrimination…”\n\nI consider Prince Asturian. What a wreck. He may be the most pathetic sap in all of this. At least the Duchess… Selene, got played in a way that required her to take initiative. …I never liked him at all, even when I had only read about him. He’s too tough. Too smothering. In an Emersonian sense, it’s likely I psychologically projected a father figure sort of image onto him, and I’ve known those never like me.\n\n“…Or perhaps even through blind luck.”\n\nI consider Selene. …Honestly, how much do I even know about her? For years, she’s been my main rival, the opponent to furthering my utopian designs. But I fear now we’re merely pieces on the same board. I still think she’s annoying, though.\nPerhaps this current setting will force us to understand one another.\n\n“…But he’s proven capable of none of these, really. This state of things will last… well, maybe a while. But not forever. His shining example of winning someone to his side cannot be a crying child. Maybe he’ll get better, improve things. Maybe he doesn’t know what’s coming. But those who do… have some obligation to prepare the world. One day, I suspect, we will see the same period of instability again, though not a planned farce the way this one was. This really was nothing but an overture.”\n\nI consider the dragon that showed up in my dreams. The hell was up with that? I still don’t know. Something weird was going on with Theodoric, too.\n\nI sigh. “An overture to the true future trials our kingdom has in store. I will do my best to act in whatever allegiance or position I can so they are overcome. Whatever your ideals, I suggest the rest of you begin thinking about the same.”\n\nI think of Lydia. What, uh… what plans does she have for… like, does she want for Aliza to work with her crime ring stuff? It might benefit her aims of activism, especially if I, her connection to legitimate government, have been deprived of power.\n\n…Is it more…… personal?\n\nI don’t know how I feel about that. It’s not— it isn’t like what we have, is it? That’s different.
