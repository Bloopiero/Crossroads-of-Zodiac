I'm 21 years old. That's something I'm sure of. That makes me well over, a grown adult. If you were to ask me any other concrete details about myself, that would be tough to answer.  I guess the quickest answer would be, to say 'what my deal' is. I'm sure you already know this from my attitude towards certain things but I don't believe in God. Wow, shocker.

Well, maybe that's not entirely untrue, I am spiteful.\"\n*I deserve to be though.*\n\"But, really, I hate our society. Really, I do.

Anyway, in a society like ours, people who are considered 'mutants' aren't exactly treated kindly. When my parents found out about this, they panicked. They claimed, I was 'tainted', and that I had been forsaken by the divine. How pitiful. But, since I was raised in this same household, I trusted my parents when they said that I can be fixed- Agh.\"\nSelle clutched at their head.\n\"...The rest is a bit fuzzy. I just know that they were told that I can't be fixed. Afterwards, they decided that I had to be offered up as a sacrifice to the divine. I'm not sure if there's any scripture that actually commands this, but, they were really in over their head for this whole religion thing. Regardless... That's the part I don't remember well. I just remember a lot of yelling and rain. That whole few weeks of my life is a blur. I just remember that one day, I started 'existing' as someone else. Someone that wasn't-.\n\n.......\n\n ...Here I am now, spiteful, full of idealism, and with a complete lack of a congruent identity, constantly on the verge of death.
