I'm 21 years old. That's something I'm sure of. That makes me well over, a grown adult. If you were to ask me any other concrete details about myself, that would be tough to answer.  I guess the quickest answer would be, to say 'what my deal' is. I'm sure you already know this from my attitude towards certain things but I don't believe in God. Wow, shocker. But I think the reasons that led to that is what actually matters. It's not like I'm some contrarian raring to deny the existence of God because I decided to be spiteful. Well, maybe that's not entirely untrue, I am spiteful.\"\n*I deserve to be though.*\n\"But, really, I hate our society. Really, I do. Partly due to some sort of idealism within me but most definitely because of what happened to me 9 years ago. 9 years ago, my world was shattered. A small and sad world. Propped up by falsities and abuse. A strict existence that adheres to the strictest of mores.\"\nSelle unwinds the bandage on their right arm.\n\"Take a look.  I've mentioned it to you before, in passing.\"\nThe arm is ashy in colour, with distinctly much darker skin than the rest of their body.\n\"This is considered 'mutant'. It's an uncurable illness. My body eats at itself constantly if I don't take medicine. I got it one day, very suddenly. I.. don't know how it got passed onto me, but it doesn't matter. Anyway, in a society like ours, people who are considered 'mutants' aren't exactly treated kindly. When my parents found out about this, they panicked. They claimed, I was 'tainted', and that I had been forsaken by the divine. How pitiful. But, since I was raised in this same household, I trusted my parents when they said that I can be fixed- Agh.\"\nSelle clutched at their head.\n\"...The rest is a bit fuzzy. I just know that they were told that I can't be fixed. Afterwards, they decided that I had to be offered up as a sacrifice to the divine. I'm not sure if there's any scripture that actually commands this, but, they were really in over their head for this whole religion thing. Regardless... That's the part I don't remember well. I just remember a lot of yelling and rain. That whole few weeks of my life is a blur. I just remember that one day, I started 'existing' as someone else. Someone that wasn't-.\n\n.......\n\n ...Here I am now, spiteful, full of idealism, and with a complete lack of a congruent identity, constantly on the verge of death. Truly, how pitiful.\"\nSelle looks at Erik. \n\"That's my answer to what my deal is.
