The door opens here, though obviously no memories are comprehensible for a while. They're raised by a pair that could without argument be labelled heretics. Their parents do nothing but harass people with questions all day about the ideas of the church and how evil they find it. They certainly have compelling ideas, but like the people at large Roshan cannot comprehend any of them. You can recall the feelings of them debating you and treating you seriously, feelings of pride about being smarter than others. More mature than others your age. The ideas themselves are incomprehensible to you, but there's an unmistakable attraction to the feeling of agreeing to them. To the idea that you're sharing in a truth too good for the masses. All of this leads into your first solid memory. Your parents are being dragged out of your home by an angry mob chanting \"Burn The Heretics!\" over and over.","author":{"id":"453258461619159070","name":"dontatmiss","discriminator":"0000","nickname":"Ismalisa","color":"#FFA6EF","isBot":false,"roles":[{"id":"1352418381185290350","name":"Warden","color":"#FFA6EF","position":4}],"avatarUrl":"Assets\\a89ee92f7df228d446585ec982e110cd-1C58D.png"},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"stickers":[],"reactions":[],"mentions":[],"inlineEmojis":[]},{"id":"1398737430395486308","type":"Default","timestamp":"2025-07-26T11:43:10.691-07:00","timestampEdited":null,"callEndedTimestamp":null,"isPinned":false,"content":"I'm watching them, but I feel like I'm really far away from my body.
