I just killed a guy for being the cause of a potential war, and now he’s showing up and going, hey, I’m actually the one who caused that, and also I killed like, a hundred children. …I don’t actually know the number or how old they were. But still, he wasn’t painting a flattering picture, so to speak, metaphor, so I went, why did you do it. Give me a reason you were trying your best. A reason not to strike you down. Anything. …I see myself in those types, y’know?

So like… My brother, Roshan, wasn’t a bad man. Person. I don’t think so, at least. Little snarky, but a smart guy, wanted to fight injustice.

Not like I even get enough about what they did to demand that, at this point. I was so fuckin’ mad at Ismalisa… well, before that point, for a lot of reasons, but… when I thought she killed me, it certainly didn’t help. It would’ve taken a miracle to get me to forgive her. Which I guess is what happened, in the form of, uh, me not dying, and actually being the one who killed her, and also she wasn’t real and I didn’t know anything about her.”\nI kind of lost track of what I was saying.\n\n“I don’t know. I mean, separate from anything else… sure. I don’t want Daryush to die. I want him to be able to come to terms with who he is and what happened to him, and like, live a good life, happily, or whatever.”\nI glance to the side uncomfortably.\n“But I can’t… I don’t know how to do that. I can’t spread myself thin. I would rather make sure one thing goes right than succeed at helping with nothing.”\n\nI stare at Seta again. \n“…I guess I’m living for that miracle now, haha. The girl I killed liking me, absolving me. …I killed her because I thought it was too late. Talked to her, trying to find some hope, but… I can say she and Douglas before her were hostile first, that I might not have had the guts without that, but, just making excuses… I thought there was no way out. That she’d live a miserable life as a living weapon fed ideas by people who hated her her whole childhood, and I could only fix that by stopping her from hurting anyone else, continuing to live miserably. But I was wrong. She gained unlimited power, and… she didn’t kill anyone. Didn’t even really try to hurt us. Not that much, at least. All she demanded was that we understand.”\n\nI blink a few times. “Um. I think the moral is that I can’t hurt Daryush too much because then I’d be saying that Seta deserved to die, which was proven wrong because she’s not all bad, not a weapon. And saying she deserves to die is also saying I do? I dunno.
